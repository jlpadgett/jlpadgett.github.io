<blockquote style="width:80%; margin-left:10%;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> In recent years, high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) have become a topic of extreme interest due to their occurrence in numerous scientific fields. Examples of such equations include the Schr&#246;dinger equation in quantum many-body problems, the nonlinear Black-Scholes equation for pricing financial derivatives, and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in dynamic programming. In each of these cases, standard numerical techniques suffer from the so-called curse of dimensionality, which refers to the computational complexity of an employed approximation method growing exponentially as a function of the dimension of the underlying problem. This phenomenon is what prevents traditional numerical algorithms, such as finite differences and finite element methods, from being efficiently employed in problems with more than, say, ten dimensions. The purpose of this talk is to introduce a novel approximation algorithm known as the multilevel Picard (MLP) approximation method for beating the curse of dimensionality in the case of semilinear PDEs. We accomplish this task by considering the equivalent stochastic fixed-point equations associated to such PDEs. The primary focus of this talk will be motivating the development of this novel algorithm and then providing rigorous L<sup>p</sup>-error and computational complexity analysis with optimal constants. Numerical examples will be provided in order to provide experimental verification of the obtained results.</blockquote>

<blockquote style="width:80%; margin-left:10%;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Deep neural networks and other deep learning methods have very successfully been applied to the numerical approximation of high-dimensional nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). In particular, simulations indicate that algorithms based on deep learning overcome the curse of dimensionality in the numerical approximation of solutions of semilinear PDEs. For certain linear PDEs this has also been proved mathematically. However, proofs in the more general case have been difficult to rigorously formulate. To that end, we present a novel framework to alleviate this issue. In this talk, we will briefly introduce the concept of deep learning and then define an abstract framework which is amenable to proving theoretical results. We then prove some auxiliary results regarding the representation of particular approximations of a class of PDEs. In particular, we prove in the case of semilinear heat equations with gradient-independent nonlinearities that the numbers of parameters of the employed deep neural networks grow at most polynomially in both the PDE dimension and the reciprocal of the prescribed approximation accuracy. Our proof relies on recently introduced full history recursive multilevel Picard approximations of semilinear PDEs.</blockquote>

<div id="myDIVtalk113" style="display:none">
<blockquote style="width:80%; margin-left:10%;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk we present a nonlinear splitting algorithm for approximating stochastic singular differential equations. In particular, we focus on problems whose singularities induce finite-time blow-up of either the solution, or its derivative, with respect to the expectation of the given norm. The proposed splitting algorithm allows for the careful handling of the singular and stochastic parts, separately. We also develop an adaptive time-stepping algorithm, based on the self-similarity of the true solution of the underlying system, which guarantees that the numerical approximation captures the asymptotic features of the problem—such as blow-up rates and blow-up time. Moreover, we provide convergence and stability results for the general abstract setting (which includes finite difference, finite element, and spectral discretizations of the spatial differential operators), demonstrating the robustness of the proposed algorithm. If time permits, we will briefly mention how the proposed method can be generalized to derive methods of arbitrarily high order. Numerical experiments will be provided to verify the theoretical results.</blockquote>

<div id="myDIVtalk112" style="display:none">
<blockquote style="width:80%; margin-left:10%;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent years have seen an increased focus on the application of non-local equations for modeling various multi-physics problems. In particular, the use of such models can potentially improve the modeling of porous media flows, as they may reduce the continuity issues which arise near reservoir flow. While these novel models offer improvements in this direction, the approximations of these equations is more difficult. As such, there is a strong need for the development and analysis of robust numerical methods for solving non-local equation related to porous media flow. In this talk, we will introduce the proposed non-local model and develop a numerical method which takes advantage of several abstract results for singular and degenerate differential equations. This approach allows for the development of a numerical method which can be applied to numerous problems of interest. Moreover, the method is quite efficient (especially when compared with other methods for similar problems). Finally, numerical simulations will be provided to verify the presented theory.</blockquote>

<blockquote style="width:80%; margin-left:10%;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Self- and cross-diffusion are important, and often neglected, nonlinear spatial derivative terms that are included into population models in ecology. These terms are especially important in modeling predator-prey interactions. Self-diffusion models overcrowding effects, while cross-diffusion incorporates the response of one species in light of the concentration of another. These important terms can complicate simulating the underlying system, rendering classical computational techniques useless (or, at least highly inefficient). In this talk, we will introduce a novel computational algorithm based on operator splitting. This method will be shown to be accurate and stable through rigorous analysis. If time permits, we will also discuss adaptive time-stepping methods which exactly preserve the blow-up rate of the original model (when blow-up occurs), which are based on the self-similarity of the underlying physical system. Numerical experiments will be presented in order to demonstrate the efficiency of this approach when considering a generalized Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto (SKT) model.</blockquote>

<blockquote style="width:80%; margin-left:10%;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> In recent years, fractional differential equations have become quite prevalent in applied mathematics. When used correctly, these non-local operators can model non-standard transport, such as anomalous diffusion, in many applications of interest (such as porous media). Approximations of fractional operators is still a highly nontrivial process as one must preserve the non-locality of the underlying operators in order of for the method to be valid. In this talk, we will introduce the notion of fractional powers of a class of abstract operators and construct appropriate approximations of these operators via a generalization of a method employed by Caffarelli and Silvestre. These techniques make no assumption of boundedness on the operators, and thus, may be employed in numerous numerical and analytical settings. The stability and convergence of this method can easily be related back to the spectral nature of the operator of interest. Numerical experiments will be presented to further verify the presented results.</blockquote>

<blockquote style="width:80%; margin-left:10%;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Operator splitting techniques were originally introduced in an effort to save computational costs in numerical simulations. Classically, such methods were restricted to dimensional splitting of evolution operators. However, these methods have since been extended to allow for splitting of problems involving nonlinear operators which evolve on vastly different time scales. In this talk I will introduce the notion of nonlinear operator splitting and rigorously justify the approach by considering some techniques from Lie group theory. This is a nonstandard presentation that should also be accessible to graduate students. The second half of the talk will provide results concerning two very interesting applications of operator splitting techniques: nonlinear stochastic problems and singular combustion problems. The former problems have traditionally been plagued with low-order techniques with restrictive regularity conditions, while the latter have the need for strongly adaptive methods which recover important qualitative properties. We will discuss in detail how operator splitting provides solutions to these issues, while also being straightforward to implement.</blockquote>

<blockquote style="width:80%; margin-left:10%;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk we introduce the notion of operator splitting for nonlinear equations. We formulate the approach in the language of Magnus expansions in abstract spaces, allowing us to combine the language of semigroups with nonlinear operators. The focus of the talk will be extending these techniques to approximating solutions of stochastic differential equations in Hilbert spaces. These approximation techniques allow for the development of numerical methods which are of arbitrary order, yet have lower regularity conditions when compared to many existing methods. Moreover, the methods may easily be generalized to differential problems posed on smooth manifolds. If time permits, we will discus how operator splitting methods may be employed to construct approximations which respect the underlying Lie group structure of the problem at hand.

The motivation for developing structure-preserving algorithms for certain classes of differential equations originates from diverse areas such as astronomy, molecular dynamics, mechanics, control theory, theoretical physics, and numerical analysis. If the equations of interest evolve on Lie groups, then geometric integration methods will guarantee that all approximations remain in the appropriate Lie group. In this talk we will consider Lie group methods for designing structure-preserving schemes with special emphasis on operator splitting methods. Operator splitting in a Lie group setting is primarily concerned with effectively approximating the exponential map and guaranteeing that such approximations map elements from the appropriate Lie algebra to the corresponding Lie group. The talk will consider concrete examples throughout, removing the need for a deep understanding of Lie group theory, and will conclude with several examples of how such methods may be applied to problems of interest.  </blockquote>

<blockquote style="width:80%; margin-left:10%;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> This talk concerns the numerical solution of multidimensional nonlinear Kawarada equations. The stochastically influenced degenerate reaction-diffusion equations exhibit strong singularities and play an important role in numerous industrial applications. Moving mesh strategies and operator splitting are utilized throughout the approach to yield favorable adaptive grids in both space and time. Highly efficient and effective nonuniform difference schemes are developed. It is shown that the numerical solution acquired not only approximates the theoretical solution satisfactorily, but also preserves the required positivity, monotonicity and stability of the solution when proper constraints are satisfied. The
latter is particularly crucial to quenching-combustion simulations. Numerical experiments are given to illustrate and demonstrate our conclusions. </blockquote>

<blockquote style="width:80%; margin-left:10%;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Exponential splitting methods have been widely utilized for computing numerical solutions of partial differential equations. Different types of error estimates for the splitting procedures have been introduced and studied. In this talk, we will
present an improved, new global error analysis for key exponential splitting formulations based on the commutativity of matrix exponentials resulting from different exponential splitting formulas.  Computational examples will be provided to illustrate our theoretical results and expectations. </blockquote>
